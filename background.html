    <h2>Background & Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      The genesis of <strong>Enigma AI</strong> stems from a profound need to build more interpretable, ethical, and purposeful AI systems. In recent years, artificial intelligence has made remarkable strides—but also raised important concerns around transparency, data privacy, and algorithmic bias. Enigma AI was created as a response to these challenges, aiming to strike a balance between powerful performance and human-aligned values.

      Inspired by the original <em>Enigma Machine</em>, which once decrypted the world’s most complex wartime codes, our project envisions AI as a tool not of obfuscation, but of illumination. We believe AI should empower researchers, creators, and citizens—not just corporations and governments. Enigma AI is driven by a commitment to open research, verifiability, and ethical design.

      The foundation of this project also draws from interdisciplinary efforts across linguistics, cognitive science, and computational ethics. By embedding these disciplines at the core of our methodology, Enigma AI distinguishes itself from conventional black-box models and embraces a more human-centric design philosophy.

      Our motivation is simple yet ambitious: to create an AI framework that not only performs well but also earns public trust. This site outlines the journey of that effort—from foundational research questions to deployment and impact.
